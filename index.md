Lille Kat is a new social programming initiative at [ITU](https://www.itu.dk).

Lille Kat events will be held monthly and are aimed at ITU students from all programmes who want to spend time solving problems, improving their programming skills, and hanging out with friends. Lille Kat aims to create a friendly and relaxed environment to practice collaborative problem solving; participants are encouraged to help each other and have fun.

The events aim to be fun and challenging for programmers of every skill level. Each event will feature a selection of problems from the [Kattis](https://www.open.kattis.com ) archive. The selected problems will range in difficulty so all participants can solve at least one question, while even the most experienced participants will be challenged by the harder problems.

Oh... and there’ll be snacks!

## When?

Lille Kat will be held on the first *or last* Friday of every month. The Kattis server opens at 15:00 so be sure to show up before then to find a seat, grab some snacks, and solve any set up issues before we start.  

The next events will be held:

- 6th of March ([join the event](https://www.facebook.com/events/196388161475613/))
- 27th of March
- 24th of April ([d-pop](https://d-pop.github.io/))
- 29th of May

## Do I have to prepare?

No formal preparation is required, you can show up at the last minute.
However:

* It’s more fun if you find some friends to team up with. Especially if you think of a good team name!
* One of you should bring a computer for programming, and you’ll need pen and paper for problem solving and collaborative thinking. Bring a charger or make sure your batteries are full.
* If you’ve never done something like this before and want to get a feeling for the type of problems appearing at the events, you can try to solve some easy problems on Open Kattis, such as [hello](https://open.kattis.com/problems/hello), [babybites](https://open.kattis.com/problems/babybites), or [guess](https://open.kattis.com/problems/guess).
This is particularly useful for learning how to read and write input and output. But don’t stress out over this beforehand – we’ll help during the event.

## Where do I ask additional questions?
