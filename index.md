Lille Kat is a social programming initiative at [ITU](https://www.itu.dk).

Lille Kat events will be held monthly and are aimed at ITU students from all study programmes who want to spend time solving problems, improving their programming skills, and hanging out with friends. Lille Kat aims to create a friendly and relaxed environment to practice collaborative problem solving; participants are encouraged to help each other and have fun.

The events aim to be fun and challenging for programmers of every skill level. Each event will feature a selection of problems from the [Kattis](https://www.open.kattis.com ) archive. The selected problems will range in difficulty so all participants can solve at least one question, while even the most experienced participants will be challenged by the harder problems.

Oh... and there’ll be snacks!

## When?

During the start of this semester Lille Kat will be held twice a month, hopefully on location at ITU. The Kattis server opens at 16:00 so be sure to show up before then to find a seat, grab some snacks, and solve any set up issues before we start.  

The next events will be held:

- Friday, 18th of September 2020, 16–19. ([Kattis link](https://open.kattis.com/contests/dbup4b))
- Friday, 2nd of October 2020, 16–19. ([Kattis link](https://open.kattis.com/contests/g6grqf))

## Lille Kat and Coronavirus

We are working to figure out the best solution for Lille Kat events this semester, currently we expect to meet in person, but with some changes. This means keeping a reasonable distance from other participants and no keyboard sharing (we can recommend looking into [Live Share](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/live-share/)), it also means Lille Kat will provide individual snacks for everyone rather than having a big pile of shared pizza and chips the way we did it pre-pandemic.

<!---
Lille Kat herself is an introvert and has been staying inside catching mice a receiving belly rubs.
However, she understands humans well enough to acknowledge their psychological craving for social interaction.

Thus, Lille Kat insists we continue having fun and continue with social events *in particular* during challenging times, even though it takes more commitment.

There will be Zoom meeting [here](https://itucph.zoom.us/j/153110293) for Lille Kat 3.
Participants are invited to join this meeting, preferably with a webcam turned on, so that we *see faces*, and *see humans eating snacks or drinking beverages* and *see friends* or even *meet new people*.
During the event, teams can go into their own virtual “breakout rooms”.
In principle, teams may be able to meet up physically, but this should be done only if they’re meeting regularly anyway – Lille Kat dislikes the virus and does not want to help it.
If you’re meeting physically, please join the zoom meeting anyway, so that the rest of us have the feeling of a *shared social event*.

## Where..  

### … do we meet?

The 2nd floor Atrium tables will be reserved for Lille Kat events. We'll set out snacks on all of these tables.


### … are the problems?

The problems for Lille Kat events are taken from [Open Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/contests/), typically grabbed from various programming contests.

## Do I have to prepare?

No formal preparation is required, you can show up at the last minute.
However:

- It’s more fun if you find some friends to team up with. Especially if you think of a good team name!
- One of you should bring a computer for programming, and you’ll need pen and paper for problem solving and collaborative thinking. Bring a charger or make sure your batteries are full.
- If you’ve never done something like this before and want to get a feeling for the type of problems appearing at the events, you can try to solve some easy problems on Open Kattis, such as [hello](https://open.kattis.com/problems/hello), [babybites](https://open.kattis.com/problems/babybites), or [guess](https://open.kattis.com/problems/guess).
This is particularly useful for learning how to read and write input and output. But don’t stress out over this beforehand – we’ll help during the event.

## Where do I ask additional questions?

Ask questions and join the conversation at the [Lille Kat channel on ITU’s Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3a3f1ac4a2adf040f1892cfe2ec12006c1%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=f8d37a29-5c53-44fd-b2c9-bed005d1aee9&tenantId=bea229b6-7a08-4086-b44c-71f57f716bdb)
