## NCPC and Coronavirus

NCPC is arranged in the middle of a global pandemic, which means that it will be somewhat different from previous years.

1. NCPC@ITU is an ITU-internal event and therefore _not_ open to participants outside of ITU.
2. Prior registration is required. This will happen through the ICPC registration system. (Link will apear here.)
3. Teams bring your own computer. (The number of computers is currently unknown.)
4. Teams remain seated at their own tables during the entire event.

We hope to be able to arrange food for contestants if the budget allows it; and this will also require prior registration of dietary preferences.

Note that the organization, both local and pan-Nordic, needs to remain flexible and is subject to change because of governmental regulations.

Feel free to join and ask questions, offer help, etc.

## Preparation

1. Find a team, preferably of fellow students that you already interact with. Your study group would be perfect; you can be at most 3. Come up with a clever team name.
2. The problem solving and programming activity Lille Kat at ITU meets regularly to solve NCPC-relevant problems and maintains a great and welcoming atmosphere.
   Just show up (no registration required). See [https://lillekat.github.io](https://lillekat.github.io).
3. Train by solving previous NCPC problems in your team. See [NCPC site](https://nordic.icpc.io). 
   As you can see, if you manage to solve just 1 problem, you are in very select company.
